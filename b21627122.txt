Beyza Ã‡evik I acknowledge that I have fully read and understood the contents of the course website;I will not share my work (not even a part of it) on Piazza; I will be responsible for what has been discussed/asked on Piazza; I will notexpect any response for my questions that have already been asked or written in a language other than English. I unerstand that if I have any questions or concerns about the course mechanics, it is my responsibility to discuss then with the instructors within their office hours.
